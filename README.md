Vue 3 TypeScript with vue class example 
Just learning new stuff along the way and took on the work already done here

#### Part 1: Vue 3 example hooks with slight modification:
 
After watcheing [Vue 3 Hooks and Type Safety with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdi-uEKYAc) 
for  code base [Grgur Grisogono: Vue3-example-hooks-ts](https://github.com/moduslabs/vue3-example-hooks-ts).

This is similar to above project, slight modifications to work with Vue 3 TypeScript with feature class enabled.

#### Part 2: [Vue 3 Todo Project converted to class](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/vue3-todolist)

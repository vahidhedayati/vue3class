Vue 3 TypeScript with vue class example 
Just learning new stuff along the way and took on the work already done here

#### Part 1: Vue 3 example hooks with slight modification:
 
After watching [Vue 3 Hooks and Type Safety with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJdi-uEKYAc) 
for [Grgur Grisogono: Vue3-example-hooks-ts](https://github.com/moduslabs/vue3-example-hooks-ts). 
 above example has been changed to work within a class feature enabled app.

#### Part 2: Vue Todo List converted from vanilla Vue 3 non Type Script to TypeScript with class feature enabled 
[Vue 3 Todo Project converted to class](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/vue3-todolist) 
converted & checked in as  
[Part 2 TodoList added](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/vue3class/commit/57e596713dcca302d111b10dd3dfd4a04b00dfda)


##### Part 3: Vuex TypeScript todo app added

[Justin Brooks has uploaded vuex-typescript-todoapp](https://github.com/jsbroks/vuex-typescript-todoapp)
